# Data Science Portfolio
## bitgrit - [Video Popularity Prediction Challenge](https://github.com/TS-0910/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Video%20Popularity%20Prediction%20Challenge_12.2.2021.ipynb)
- [The overall description](https://bitgrit.net/competition/11#)<br/>
- Checked correlation coefficient and correlation ratio for feature engineering
- Used Linear Regression(ElasticNet and Ridge Regression as well)
- Tried light gbm and cross validation

## Kaggle - [House Prices](https://github.com/TS-0910/Kaggle_House_Prices/blob/master/house-price-ts-0910%20(1).ipynb)
- [The overall description](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- used the basic idea of [Pedro Marcelino's example solution](https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python) to approach the features, which are<br/>
1.Basic idea of which features are important, and which can be eliminated<br/>
2.Transformation of important features using logs<br/>
- Used light gbm to predict the price
- RMSE = 0.13980(test data)
